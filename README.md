# SEGA G-Loc Motor Driver PCBs repro & remake attempt.

SEGA G-Loc is a full motion arcade flight simulator from 1990.

It has a motor logic control board and 2 motor driver boards (400-5117 or 400-5117Y).
These motor drivers are known to fail for a number of reasons.

This project is an attempt to:

1. Make a clone of the motor driver pcb (400-5117).
2. Make a newer desgin of the board, using modern components.
