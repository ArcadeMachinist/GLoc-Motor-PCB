# SEGA GLoc Motor Driver PCBs repro attempt.

SEGA G-Loc is a full motion arcade flight simulator for 1990.

It has a motor logic control board and 2 motor driver boards.
These motor drivers are known to fail for number of reasons.

This project is an attempt to make a clone of the motor driver pcb, using newer components, when possible/reasonable.
